#Steps to be followed:
#1.Go to camera--go to photos--click on screen 5000 times(aging of scripts)

# Import necessary modules
import uiautomator2 as ui2
import time
import subprocess

# Device serial number of the receiver device
receiver_device_serial = "192.168.2.237:5555"

# Create a Device object for the receiver device
receiver_device = ui2.Device(receiver_device_serial)

receiver_device(text="Camera").click()
time.sleep(2)
receiver_device(resourceId="com.android.camera2:id/mode_scroll_text", text="Photo").click()
time.sleep(2)
# Define the number of clicks you want to perform
num_clicks = 5000  # Click 5000 times

# Perform clicks in a loop
for i in range(1, num_clicks + 1):
    receiver_device.click(0.775, 0.447)
    print(f"Clicked on screen successfully (Iteration {i})")
    # You may want to introduce a delay between clicks if needed
    time.sleep(1)
receiver_device(resourceId="com.android.systemui:id/center_group").click()
